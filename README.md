# FastFoodApi is a web Api design for Take Away Kebab Shop to processing an Order made by a Customer
In this project, I am building a full REST API using .NET Core 3.1.
I am implemtenting a Web Api using MVC, REST, the Repository Pattern, 
Dependency Injection, Entity Framework, Data Transfer Objects, (DTOs),
AutoMapper to provide 6 API endpoints that will allow a user to Create, Read, Update and Delete resources.
